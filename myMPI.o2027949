POISSON_SERIAL:
  C version
  A program for solving the Poisson equation.

  -DEL^2 U = F(X,Y)

  on the rectangle 0 <= X <= 1, 0 <= Y <= 1.

  F(X,Y) = pi^2 * ( x^2 + y^2 ) * sin ( pi * x * y )

  The number of interior X grid points is 11
  The number of interior Y grid points is 11
  The X grid spacing is 0.100000
  The Y grid spacing is 0.100000
  RMS of F = 4.81514
  RMS of exact solution = 0.600498

  Step    ||Unew||     ||Unew-U||     ||Unew-Exact||

     0         0.28748                        0.527212
the elapsed time is 0.000000
